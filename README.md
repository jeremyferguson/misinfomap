# Misinformation + COVID-19 chronological location map

## Project objective
This project aims to search for a correlation betweeen the spread of COVID-19 within geographical areas, and the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 within those same areas.  
This is done by scraping Tweets about COVID-19 over a set time interval and searching tweets for certain keywords related to misinformation (i.e. "hoax").  The result of this search is then filtered by state, and graphed over time.

## Viewing the data
Viewing the data can be done within the IPython notebook "Heatmap_widgets.ipynb".  The notebook displays a slider which can be used to see the time progression of COVID-19 cases, and hovering over any individual state will show the progression of confirmed cases and detected misinformation trends for that state.
